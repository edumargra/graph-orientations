This repository contains the source code related to the bachelor's thesis "Efficient generation of high digirth orientations".
The author is Eduard Martin Graells and the tutor is Kolja Knauer.

To execute the code simply (with the Sage software installed) do the following:
1. Open a terminal prompt in the folder.
2. Attach the desired files with `attach(<name of the file>.py)`.
You can now call the functions directly.

In the case that you don't have Sage installed, you can do so by following this [link](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html).
